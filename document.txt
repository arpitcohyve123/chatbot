Case Study: Fevicol – “Tug-of-War” Instagram Remix Challenge 
Campaign Title: Fevicol ka Jod – Remix Challenge 
Launch Year: 2023 
Platform: Instagram (Reels) 
Agency: Schbang 
Brand Owner: Pidilite Industries 
Market: India 
Objective 
Fevicol’s objective was to bring alive its core brand promise—“unbreakable bond”—in a format 
relevant to Gen-Z and millennial audiences, particularly on Instagram. The goal was: 
● To reintroduce and refresh the iconic “Tug-of-War” ad (originally launched decades ago) 
for a new digital-first audience. 
● To drive high-volume user-generated content (UGC) by leveraging Instagram’s Remix 
feature, where users could interact with brand content in real time. 
● To strengthen brand salience and emotional connection by reviving a legacy brand 
mnemonic using humor, challenge, and interactive storytelling. 
The ultimate aim was brand rejuvenation through community participation. 
Brief 
Pidilite briefed its agency, Schbang, with the following core deliverables: 
● Modernize an old classic: Take Fevicol’s legendary “tug-of-war” ad and give it a fresh, 
social-first interpretation. 
● Make it participatory: Don’t just run a static campaign—let users interact, remix, and 
create their own versions. 
● Stick to the soul: The tone, humor, and character of Fevicol campaigns (Indian desi wit, 
rural aesthetic, and minimalism) must be preserved. 
● Deliver relevance, not just reach: Drive meaningful UGC and community interaction, not 
just passive ad views. 
● Avoid heavy budgets: Use lean production and distribution—focus on content quality, 
platform virality, and creator partnerships. 
The campaign needed to appeal to Tier 1 and Tier 2 India alike, without sounding 
“advertising-y”. 
Insight 
The creative and strategic insights were multi-layered: 
● Behavioral Insight: Audiences today don’t want to just watch ads—they want to 
participate. Instagram’s Remix feature (which allows users to record their video 
side-by-side with an existing reel) had recently gained momentum. 
● Cultural Insight: Fevicol ads have built cultural memory around clever visual metaphors 
of “bonding.” The iconic rope-pull trope symbolized collective effort and failure to break a 
Fevicol bond—a humorous, family-friendly visual. 
● Content Insight: Remix-based challenges on Instagram tend to go viral when they’re: 
○ Visually simple 
○ Emotionally or physically challenging 
○ Open-ended enough for creators to experiment 
○ Seeded with early influencer participation 
These led to the idea of a remixable “tug-of-war” reel, where Fevicol invites everyone to try 
pulling—but no one can break the bond. 
Execution 
Core Concept: 
Schbang recreated a minimal reel featuring a rope tied to a jar of Fevicol. A person tries (and 
fails) to pull it—representing the brand’s legendary bond strength. Users were invited to remix 
the video by “pulling” the other end of the rope in their own style—comedy, dance, spoof, or 
even skits. 
Execution Timeline: 
● Phase 1: Create the master reel from Fevicol's Instagram account 
● Phase 2: Seed with influencers (micro and mid-tier) to generate momentum 
● Phase 3: Encourage organic remixes and interact with users 
● Phase 4: Showcase top remixes across Fevicol’s own handles 
Key Actions: 
● Video Design: Simple top-angle, minimal prop usage. Rugged background to retain 
brand tone. 
● Captioning: Witty one-liners with typical Fevicol-style humor. 
● Call to Action: Encouraged users to remix with "Let’s see if you can break the bond!" 
● Influencer Seeding: 
○ Saurabh Ghadge: Used slapstick humor to participate. 
○ Viral Fission: Built remix activity across campuses and Gen-Z communities. 
● Community Engagement: 
○ Fevicol replied to select remixers in-character, building brand love. 
○ Reposted funny, high-effort remixes as stories and carousel posts. 
○ Used tongue-in-cheek one-liners to describe attempts. 
Media Investment: 
● No paid media initially. Relied on earned media and influencer amplification. 
● After organic traction, light paid boosts were applied on top-performing reels. 
Results 
Quantitative Results: 
● 1.8 million+ views across primary reel and remix chain 
● 610,000+ total engagements (likes, shares, saves, comments) 
● 350+ remix videos, of which 130 were fully organic (not seeded or paid) 
● Avg. Watch Time per reel: Higher than standard FMCG Instagram ad benchmarks (2.1x 
industry avg) 
● Engagement Split: 
○ 1.3K+ shares 
○ 408 comments 
○ 179 saves 
Qualitative Results: 
● A large number of the remixes were comedic, showing high creative flexibility and 
cultural fit. 
● Positive comments around "nostalgia," "smart idea," and "Fevicol always wins" created a 
brand halo. 
● The campaign reignited brand love without heavy ATL or digital spend. 
Business Relevance: 
● Drove 30% spike in branded search queries on Google in the following 14 days. 
● Instagram followers grew by 11% during campaign period. 
● Became a talking point in multiple marketing publications and award entries.

Case Study: Nike – “Dream Crazy” ft. Colin Kaepernick (2018) 
Campaign Name: Dream Crazy 
Brand: Nike 
Agency: Wieden+Kennedy (Portland) 
Platform: TV, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Out-of-home (OOH) 
Launch: September 2018 
Market: Global, with focus on USA 
Objective 
Nike’s aim was to: 
● Reinvigorate the “Just Do It” slogan on its 30th anniversary with cultural relevance and 
emotional power. 
● Reconnect with younger, socially conscious consumers (Gen Z, Millennials) through 
values-based branding. 
● Celebrate athlete activism and amplify stories of perseverance, equality, and courage, 
particularly among minorities. 
● Reassert Nike’s leadership as a brand that doesn't just sell performance gear, but stands 
for social and cultural momentum. 
Brief 
The client brief to Wieden+Kennedy was to: 
● Develop a flagship campaign that honors the legacy of “Just Do It” but speaks directly to 
today’s social and cultural context. 
● Find a central figure who personifies sacrifice, belief, and disruption—in line with Nike's 
mission to champion bold dreamers. 
● Create content that is multi-format, shareable, and emotionally resonant across 
generations. 
● Balance provocation with authenticity—the idea should generate conversation, even 
controversy, but be anchored in truth and courage. 
● Roll out globally, with emphasis on US market, and scale across traditional and digital 
platforms including retail stores. 
Insight 
The campaign insight was threefold: 
a. Cultural Insight: 
● Audiences—especially younger ones—expect brands to stand for something beyond 
product. Remaining neutral on divisive social issues is increasingly seen as weakness or 
inauthenticity. 
● Colin Kaepernick had become an icon of modern civil rights discourse in the US by 
kneeling during the national anthem in protest against racial injustice. He was both 
revered and reviled, making him the perfect embodiment of modern activism. 
b. Human Insight: 
● Great athletes are often defined not just by what they win, but by what they are willing to 
lose in pursuit of their beliefs. 
● Sacrifice is the highest form of belief—and belief is at the core of Nike’s brand DNA. 
c. Brand Insight: 
● The original “Just Do It” slogan stood for individual bravery. “Dream Crazy” updates it for 
a new era—where bravery also means standing up for something bigger than yourself. 
Execution 
Master Film: 
● The campaign launched with a two-minute cinematic video narrated by Colin 
Kaepernick, showcasing athletes who overcame the odds—like Serena Williams, LeBron 
James, and Shaquem Griffin (a one-handed NFL player). 
● Kaepernick closes the film with the line: 
“Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.” 
Rollout Timeline: 
● Day 1: Kaepernick Tweeted the still image (black and white, close-up portrait) with the 
line. It went viral instantly.

● Week 1: Billboard and mural placements across major US cities.

3:1 favorability among younger users.

Case Study 1: Dropbox Rebrand by COLLINS (2017) 
Objective: 
Dropbox wanted to evolve from a file-sharing utility to a platform for creative collaboration. The 
goal was to move perception from “cloud storage” to “creative enabler.” 
Insight: 
Most cloud tools are sterile and blue-themed. Dropbox had the chance to own a bold, creative 
voice by doing the opposite—leaning into expressive design and dynamic color. 
Logo Design: 
● The box symbol evolved from a literal open box into a set of modular, dynamic brackets, 
symbolizing a container for creativity. 
● Kept the original structure for equity but refined geometry and grid to enhance scalability 
and minimalism. 
● The wordmark was redrawn in a custom sans-serif to feel cleaner and more timeless. 
Visual System: 
● Introduced intense color palettes (magenta, electric green, aqua, orange) paired with 
muted black-and-white backgrounds. 
● Created 45+ grid combinations of box shapes used across web, motion, and print. 
● Allowed designers to remix colors and layouts, making the system flexible and open. 
Packaging Touch: 
● Dropbox Paper kits shipped in custom boxes with the new identity. 
● Swag and event materials used fluorescent Pantones and kinetic typography to embody 
the brand’s “Creative Energy” message. 
Result: 
● Controversial launch led to massive discussion across design forums, helping Dropbox 
own a cultural moment. 
● Internally, rebrand galvanized product and design teams to think more creatively. 
● Became a brand identity case study in design schools and was featured in Brand New, 
Behance, and Wired. 
Case Study 2: Tropicana Packaging Redesign & Backlash (2009) 
Objective: 
Modernize the brand to feel more premium and minimalist while appealing to health-conscious 
buyers. 
Insight: 
Customers associated the orange with a straw (from the original design) with freshness, 
childhood, and authenticity. Changing it removed a powerful memory anchor. 
Execution: 
● Logo was downsized and moved to top left. 
● Orange-and-straw image was replaced with a generic glass of juice. 
● Introduced sleek type and flat design to modernize. 
Result: 
● $35M spent on design and distribution. 
● Sales dropped 20% within two months, losing $30M+ in revenue. 
● Customers flooded customer service with complaints about losing “their orange juice.” 
● Reverted to original design within 60 days. 
Learning for AI: 
● Visual memory is as critical as strategy. 
● Brand cues that seem “dated” may be cultural assets, not liabilities. 
● Design change must be tested across real user behavior, not just internal aesthetics. 
Case Study 3: CRED – Logo & Brand Identity (2020) 
By Codesign and CRED’s in-house brand team 
Objective: 
Build an elite, trustworthy, yet futuristic brand that would appeal to India’s top 1%—a 
creditworthy, tech-savvy audience who value design and exclusivity. 
Insight: 
Trust, privacy, and sophistication are key. Brand needed to feel like a mix of a Swiss bank and a 
design magazine—minimal, luxurious, and coded. 
Logo: 
● Inspired by ancient coins and bank vaults, the CRED shield represents integrity and 
exclusivity. 
● The monogram “C” forms a subtle vault enclosure—a metaphor for protection. 
● Paired with a modern, extended sans-serif wordmark for a tech-forward look. 
Visual Language: 
● Primary palette: Black, White, Grey, Gold Accents 
● Heavy use of negative space, monoline icons, and editorial typography. 
● All imagery treated with grain and noir tones to feel cinematic and elevated. 
Packaging: 
● CRED Coins (member rewards) shipped in tactile black boxes with foiled embossing. 
● Welcome kits featured soft-touch paper, sealed envelopes, and embossed thank-you 
notes. 
Result: 
● Instant recognition in India’s design and tech scenes. 
● Became known for mature, monochromatic campaigns that stood apart in a loud digital 
world. 
● Inspired a wave of black-and-white brand redesigns in Indian fintech. 
Case Study 4: Glossier – Brand & Packaging (2014) 
Objective: 
Create a millennial-first beauty brand that felt honest, minimal, and personal—opposite of 
traditional makeup's glamorized ads. 
Insight: 
The target user cared about real skin, real routines, and aspirational minimalism. The brand 
should reflect a “beauty-in-real-life” sensibility. 
Logo & Wordmark: 
● Lowercase sans-serif logo to feel approachable. 
● Simple, elegant logotype with soft kerning—easy to adapt to stickers, tubes, and social 
content. 
Packaging: 
● Pale pink bubble wrap pouches—unexpected but protective, becoming a cult object. 
● Products had white tubes with black type, clear bottles, and pastel pink caps. 
● Stickers included for personalization—letting customers “own” their packaging. 
Result: 
● Created millennial pink trend in packaging. 
● Bubble bag became a viral symbol of DTC design—posted as often as the product. 
● Packaging made the unboxing feel like a soft, tactile ritual.

Brief

formats. 
3. Balanced global consistency with market-specific tweaks.
